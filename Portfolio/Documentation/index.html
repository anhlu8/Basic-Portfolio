            might find themselfs comfortable directly editing the template since it has a clean, straightforward and easy

            <h2>Layout</h2>
            <p>The template uses a responsive layout with maximum width of 960px.</p>

            <h2>Header</h2>
            <h3>Changing the name and profession</h3>
            <p>In order to change the most important thing in the whole template - the name and profession in the header you
                will have to open the included PSD file (with Adobe Photoshop), and edit the info there. You will find the
                desired entry in header > logo. After the editing is completed simply re-export the logo and replace
                <code>./img/logo.png</code>. You do need some advanced knowledge in using Photoshop, and of course a licensed copy
                of the software.</p>
            <h3>Changing menu entry labels &amp; urls</h3>
            <p>Open
                <code>./index.html</code> and locate
                <code>&lt;ul class="navigation"&gt;</code>. There inside each
                <code>li</code> you have a link with attribute
                <code>data-original-title</code> - change the value for the tooltip text, and inside a
                <code>span</code> element with class
                <code>title</code> - change the text to change the menu label. You wont need to change the urls here or you will
                lose the single page scroll effect. Only the last anchor has an empty
                <code>href</code> where you should put the path to your downloadable resume.</p>

            <h2>Home</h2>
            <h3>Changing the featured design entry</h3>
            <p>The homepage contains a single featured design entry. To change it open
                <code>./index.html</code> and locate
                <code>&lt;h3&gt;Featured in &lt;a </code>, there you can change the path of the image and portfolio section to
                the desired ones. Change portfolio section link
                <code>href</code> to # and the id of the section (explained later). Change the
                <code>data-featured-gallery</code> attribute to # and the id of the portfolio section gallery (explained later).
                Change the
                <code>data-featured-index</code> to a number identifying which item should be open from the desired portfolio gallery.
                F.e. if you want to identify the first element, put 0, if you want the second, put 1 etc.</p>

            <h2>Section heading</h2>
            <h3>Changing section heading left &amp; right texts</h3>
            <p>To change the text locate a
                <code>h1</code> element and simply edit the text in the left &amp; right parts.</p>

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <h3>Changing the text</h3>
            <p>To change the text simply locate the about me section marked with a comment like
                <code>&lt;!-- ABOUT ME --&gt;</code> and edit the content.</p>
            <h3>Female head</h3>
            <p>There is a female version of the code head graphic used in this section, it is located in
                <code>./img/code-head-female.png</code>. To use it, simply rename the original to something else and then rename
                the female version back to
                <code>./img/code-head.png</code>.</p>

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <h3>Changing the text</h3>
            <p>Simply locate the skills section marked as
                <code>&lt;!-- SKILLS --&gt;</code> and edit the text.</p>
            <h3>Editing the skills</h3>
            <p>You already have 10 skills divided in two columns, to edit them simply locate each and change the URL and text
                of the skill. You can also edit the
                <code>data-original-title</code> attribute for the tooltip. To change the level of the skill locate
                <code>data-progress</code> and change the value to something else (in percent of course).</p>
            <h3>Changing work experience</h3>
            <p>Editing your work experience is as easy as adding / removing / editing the contents of the
                <code>li</code> tags inside
                <code>&lt;ul class="work"&gt;</code> section. Just use the provided example. If you place too many entries they
                will translate on the next row, which would change the original design of the template, but will still look
                good.</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>Changing the projects</h3>
            <p>You can have as many galleries as you like, just don't forget to use unique ids for the portfolio section &amp;
                gallery. Each project lives inside a
                <code>li</code> element and can have a thumbnail in
                <code>class="thumbnail"</code> and different markup in the
                <code>class="info"</code>.

                <h2>Contacts</h2>
                <h3>Changing the text</h3>
                <p>To change the contact text locate the section marked as
                    <code>&lt;!-- CONTACTS --&gt;</code> and edit the text. The form doesn't need any modifications.</p>

                <h2>Footer</h2>
                <h3>Change the footer copyright &amp; social icons</h3>
                <p>Locate the
                    <code>footer</code> element and edit the copyright info and/or social icons as you wish. Included are 3 icon
                    styles, but you can always create/buy/find more, just remember that they need to be 20px by 20px.</p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>You can always change the background of the header &amp; footer by specifying a class for the
                    <code>header</code> and
                    <code>footer</code> tags. All available classes can be found in
                    <code>css/style.css</code> or on the preview page.</p>
